This is the repository for my personal GitHub pages website. It was built using HTML, SCSS and TypeScript, using GitHub actions to automatically build and deploy the HTML/CSS/JS version.

The actual hosted content of the website can be viewed in the 'gh-pages' branch; https://github.com/eyeonspringfield/eyeonspringfield.github.io/tree/gh-pages
